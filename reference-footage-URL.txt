BBC - The Wonder of Animals - Episode 5
The footage used/viewed via Anilyzer has been taken down from YouTube as of Dec 15 evening.
The same video can be found on the BBC's youtube channel, but it is horizontally
mirrored relative to the version that I used earlier.

The timecodes noted in my sketchbook pages don't align with the video currently available
on YouTube.

Referencing "How foxes use magnetic fields to catch prey - The Wonder of Animals: Episode 5 Preview - BBC Four "

the 1:55 - 2:35 section of the video corresponds to the action shown in my animation.
